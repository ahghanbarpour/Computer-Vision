**Desire for Computers to See**

We are awash in images.

Smartphones have cameras, and taking a photo or video and sharing it has never been easier, resulting in the incredible growth of modern social networks like Instagram.

YouTube might be the second largest search engine and hundreds of hours of video are uploaded every minute and billions of videos are watched every day.

The internet is comprised of text and images. It is relatively straightforward to index and search text, but in order to index and search images, algorithms need to know what the images contain. For the longest time, the content of images and video has remained opaque, best described using the meta descriptions provided by the person that uploaded them.

To get the most out of image data, we need computers to “see” an image and understand the content.

This is a trivial problem for a human, even young children.

-A person can describe the content of a photograph they have seen once.

-A person can summarize a video that they have only seen once.

-A person can recognize a face that they have only seen once before.

We require at least the same capabilities from computers in order to unlock our images and videos.
